Dear <name>, 
 
Thank you for participating in the tagging program. Although you did not capture any 
tagged crab this season, crab that you had previously released were captured and information 
sent in. This information is shown in a chart provided. I have included a token 
of our appreciation for your efforts. Recaptures such as these will help us better track 
the movement of crab across the Scotian shelf.

Dear <name>, 
 
Thanks for returning the snow crab <tag/tags> caught last season. I have included a token 
of our appreciation for your efforts in returning this information. I have also 
included a chart showing the release and recapture positions for the <tag/tags>.
The information provided by such tagging recaptures is helpful in determining the movement 
of snow crab throughout the Scotian Shelf.

<PARAGRAPH info>
The tagged crab you caught <was/were/wereall> tagged in the <yeartagged/yearstagged/season/seasons>.
</PARAGRAPH info>

<PARAGRAPH capturedbefore>
<onebefore/somebefore> of the tagged crab you caught <wasb/wereb> captured before and released. Helpful
knowledge is gained from captures such as these, especially if they are once again returned to the water. 
The data for this is shown in the charts provided.

<PARAGRAPH capturedafter>
<oneafter/someafter> of the tagged crab you caught and released in the past <wasa/werea> captured this season. Thank you
for releasing <this/these> crab. This knowledge is very helpful in tracking the movements of crab.
The data for this is shown in the charts provided.

<PARAGRAPH notreleased>
In the future, please release all tagged crab back to the water alive after 
recording the tag number. This tag number can then be returned to DFO Science with the 
relevant information such as date and location of capture. It will be treated in the same 
manner as when we receive the actual tag. We hope that additional knowledge will be gained 
by tracking subsequent recaptures of individual crab over time.

<PARAGRAPH released>
Thank you for releasing all tagged crab back to the water alive after recording the tag 
number and relevant information such as date and location of capture. The data you submitted
will be treated in the same manner as when we receive the actual tag. We hope that additional
knowledge will be gained by tracking subsequent recaptures of individual crab over time. 
</PARAGRAPH released>

<PARAGRAPH mixedrelret>
Thank you for releasing some of the tagged crab back to the water. The relevant data that you 
submit from these releases will be treated in the same manner as when we receive the actual tag. 
We hope that additional knowledge will be gained by tracking subsequent recaptures of individual 
crab over time. In the future, please release all tagged crab back to the water.  
</PARAGRAPH mixedrelret>

<PARAGRAPH unknownrel>
From the data we have recieved it was unclear whether you released or retained the tagged crab.
In the future please include this data along with the other relevant data. Our hope is that all 
tagged crab will be released back to the water so that additional knowledge will be gained by 
tracking subsequent recaptures of individual crab over time.

<PARAGRAPH final>
I have included a one page information sheet on our tagging program. On the reverse side of 
this sheet is a form which can easily be used to record all required information on any 
tagged crab you may catch in the future. This entire form can be mailed to DFO Science at 
the end of the snow crab season. 
</PARAGRAPH final>

Thanks for your help.
